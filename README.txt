ABOUT THIS VERSION
------------------
This is a ProcessWire 2.1 development version and it's posted here just
for testing by a few individuals. While you certainly can attempt to 
install it, I don't recommend doing so unless you've already talked with
Ryan because this is not a stable version. Instead you should download 
ProcessWire 2.0 at http://processwire.com/download/
