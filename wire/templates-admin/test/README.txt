This theme is here for testing purposes only and will not remain here.
It is bundled in the dev branch since it is being used as a testbed for
new features being added to support admin themes. 

To install, move the contents of this directory to: 
/site/templates-admin/

(Do not replace the /wire/templates-admin/ with this directory.)

COLOR SCHEMES
=============
This theme comes with two color schemes: 

- futura: similar to Nikola's Futura theme colors. 
- warm: warm and friendly color scheme. 
- classic: similar colors to PW original admin theme. 

To switch to one or the other, specify a GET variable of 'colors' in any 
URL you are accessing in the admin:

/processwire/?colors=futura
/processwire/?colors=classic
/processwire/?colors=warm
